AV-Wiring-Standards
===================

#Introduction
This is an effort to consolidate best practices and documentation for AV wiring specifically targeted but not limited to the education market. This document addresses Trinity University specifc needs but may be adapted as needed.

#Termination Labeling
##Color Code
Any fiber or Cat(X) cable that is for AV systems will be **violet/purple** in communication rooms and in the classroom or designated installation space.
##Labels
All labels should state "AV" in bold letters and "CLT x7323".  If the correct color cannot be used put a big sticker (violet/purple) nearby boldly stating that your color indicates AV cables, again with (CLT x7323). 

Put a clear heat shrink wrap around each cable label.

Label each cable at both ends with both the source and destination (e.g., "from DVR HDMI 1 to Switcher Input 4").

If available use an alphanumeric code that matches the system schematics (e.g., "H1001", where H stands for HDMI and 1001 is shown on the schematic, and in a table as well, as running from, DVD 1 to Switcher Input 4."). 

Use Velcro only. No tie wraps should be used to anchor and support cables. 

#RS-232
All RS-232 connections must have cable restraint and be supplied with thumb screws.
