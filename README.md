AV-Wiring-Installation-Standards
===================

#Introduction
This is an effort to consolidate best practices and documentation for AV wiring specifically targeted but not limited to the education market. This document addresses [Trinity University](http://trinity.edu) specifc needs but may be adapted as needed.

#Termination Labeling

##Color Code
Any fiber or Category(X) cable that is for AV systems will be **violet/purple** in communication rooms and in the classroom or designated installation space.

##Labels
All labels should state "AV" in bold letters and "CLT x7323".  If the correct color cannot be used put a big sticker (violet/purple) nearby boldly stating that your color indicates AV cables, again with (CLT x7323). 

Put a clear heat shrink wrap around each cable label.

Label each cable at both ends with both the source and destination (e.g., "from DVR HDMI 1 to Switcher Input 4").

If available use an alphanumeric code that matches the system schematics (e.g., "H1001", where H stands for HDMI and 1001 is shown on the schematic, and in a table as well, as running from, DVD 1 to Switcher Input 4."). 

Use Velcro only. No tie wraps should be used to anchor and support cables. 

##Vendor Specific Needs
All cabling should meet or exceed when needed all required guidelines to meet vendor warranties for equipment. This includes but is not limited to Category Cable number grade and terminiation requirement.

#Cable Management
All low voltage cables must be routed in proper cable trays, chases, or guides. Cable bundles will use appropriate J-hooks. These will be anchored to existing infrastructure as needed to ensure secure and easy to service cabling. 

No cables will lay loose above drop ceilings. Contact with lighting systems and other AC power will be avoided. Additionally, AV cables should never run alongside nor be attached to any power or lighting cables.

#Coaxial Cable

##Resident Halls and Classrooms
If CATV is required, connection must be one continuous piece of RG-6 cable and be a "home run" to the communication closet/IDF. Termination will be a female f connector.

#AC Power
All circuits designated for the AV systems installation should originate from the same electrical panel. All grounds shall be bonded together at the electric panel on a common buss bar or similar ground connection. The desk and the projector AC power should be on the same breaker, same phase leg, and same ground. It shall be an uninterrupted "home run" from the room to the circuit breaker panel. No other outlets or equipment may be added on to this circuit.

#RS-232
All RS-232 connections must have cable restraint and be supplied with thumb screws.

#Adapters
All effort must be made to avoid the use of gender changers and adapters for installation. Consultations with owner is required if deemed necessary.
